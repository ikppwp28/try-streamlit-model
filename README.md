This is the documentation about the prototype. I just try how to using streamlit deploy model machine learning about prototype to predict customer churn or not churn.
1. You first must to "pip install stremlit" and create account in stremlit
2. Run this to command prompt "python -m streamlit run app.py"
3. After that, you direct to the server localhost.
4. It's done and then you can using the prototype.
